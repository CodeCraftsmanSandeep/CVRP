## Key things to know before reading further:
1) **Exploring in solution space**: When I say exploring in solution space, I am referring to randomizing out neighbours of each vertex in graph to generate different DFS orderings and then later chuncking them into routes. 
2) CCW - Counter Clock Wise, ACW - Anti Clock Wise

## Summary 

| Name | Description | Results | 
|:-----|:-------------|:----|
| Method 1 | **Auxilary graph G construction:** <br/> - For each customer the out neighbours are the ones which are there in cone regoin (defined by sweeping vector (depot->customer) +theta and -theta) and making sure atmost D out neighbouts. <br/> - For depot every customer is out-neighbour <br/> <br/> **Tunable parameters (we have complete control on):** <br/> i) rho (the number of iterations to explore the solution) <br/> ii) theta <br/> iii) D <br/> <br/> **Algo:** Using G instead of MST in seqMDS| |
| Method 2 | **Auxilary graph G construction:** <br/> - For each customer the out neighbours are the ones which are there in cone regoin (defined by sweeping vector (depot->customer) +theta and -theta) and making sure atmost D out neighbouts. <br/> - Push all MST edges into G <br/> <br/> **Tunable parameters (we have complete control on):** <br/> i) rho (the number of iterations to explore the solution) <br/> ii) theta <br/> iii) D <br/> <br/> **Algo:** Using G instead of MST in seqMDS | | 
| Method 3 | **Algo:** <br/> - Divide the 2-d plane into ceil(360 / alpha) partitions equally by the partition lines which are drawn like this: x-axis is first line and then next line would be alpha degrees making with x-axis in CCW and second line would be making alpha degrees making with first line in CCW and so on ... <br/> - In each partition construct MST, and now different solutions are explored in this MST by iterating rho number of times and optimal routes are taken. <br/> <br/> **Tunable parameters (we have complete control on):** <br/> i) rho (the number of iterations to explore the solution) <br/> ii) alpha <br/> | | 
| Method 4 | **Algo:** <br/> - Divide the 2-d plane into ceil(360 / alpha) partitions equally by the partition lines which are drawn like this: x-axis is first line and then next line would be alpha degrees making with x-axis in CCW and second line would be making alpha degrees making with first line in CCW and so on ... <br/> - In each partition construct auxilary graph G, such that each vertex has D out neighbours <br/> - every customer is out-neighbour of depot <br/> <br/> **Tunable parameters (we have complete control on):** <br/> i) rho (the number of iterations to explore the solution) <br/> ii) alpha <br/> iii) D <br/> | | 
| Method 5 | **Algo:** Instead of maintaint same MST for exploring solution in method 3, I will generate lambda different MST's and for each MST I will explore in solution space for rho number of iterations. Here different MST's are generated by choosing random starting vertex from the partition. <br/> <br/> **Tunable parameters (we have complete control on):** <br/> i) rho (the number of iterations to explore the solution) <br/> ii) alpha <br/> iii) lambda <br/> | |

## Additional
- We can try different statergies in randomizing
- This every customer is out-neighbour of depot is helpful in situtations like when you are working with small partition. Because If you are working with entire plane then routes construction in DFS gets screwed. 

- Method to generate different MST's for the same graph using Prim's algo:
    - Change the starting vertex
    - Change the tie breaking policy (should be explored!!)
